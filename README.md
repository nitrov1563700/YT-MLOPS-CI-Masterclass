# MLOps-CI-GitHub-Actions

This reprository demonstrates a **Continous Integration(CI)**
for a Python-based MLOps project using **GitHub Actions**.

The goal of this project is to understand how CI works in 
real-world
MLOps workflows by automatically testing code on every change.

---
## Project Overview 

-Simple Python application (app.py)
-Unit test using **PyTest**
-Automated CI pipeline using **GitHub Action**
-CI triggers on every push and pull request 

This project is created for **Learning and demonstration purposes**

## CI Explanation

The GitHub Actions pipeline performs the following steps:

1. Check out the reposiory
2. Sets up the Python enviroment
3. Install dependencies
4. Runs unit tests automatically

This ensure that new code changes do not break existing functionality.
